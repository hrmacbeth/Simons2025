# Structures
* Main reference: [The Lean Language Reference](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/), in particular [¬ß 4.4.2](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/The-Type-System/Inductive-Types/#structures).

The usual way to define a `structure` is to write its name, then `where` (or `:=`, but this syntax has been deprecated) and then the
list of fields that we want a term of the structure to be made of

    structure MyStructure where
        firstfield : firstType
        secondfield : secondType
        ...
        lastfield : lastType

where each field is a term in some known type. Every field can depend upon the previous ones.

* Often, some `nthType` is in `Prop`, so `nthfield : nthType` is a *proof* that the corresponding condition is satisfied.


Declaring a structure as above automatically creates several terms:
1. A term `MyStructure.mk : firstType ‚Üí secondType ‚Üí ... ‚Üí lastType ‚Üí MyStructure` to *construct*
terms..
1. A term `MyStructure.nthfield : MyStructure ‚Üí nthType`: this *projects* a term of type
`MyStructure` onto its `nth` field.
1. If the attribute `@[ext]` is prepended on the line before the declaration, a theorem
`MyStructure.ext` is created, of type
    ```
    ‚àÄ {x y : MyStructure}, x.firstfield = y.firstfield ‚Üí ... ‚Üí x.lastfield = y.lastfield ‚Üí x = y
    ```
saying that if all fields of two terms coincide, the terms themselves coincide.

* If `nthType = Prop`, the arrow `x.(n-1)stfield = y.(n-1)stfield ‚Üí x.nthfield = y.nthfield`
is skipped thanks to proof irrelevance. Another theorem `MyStructure.ext_iff` is also added,
that adds the reverse implication.

+++ Useful calls
The call `whatsnew in` on the line preceeding the `structure` makes Lean shows all
newly created declarations.

The call `#print MyStructure` has Lean print all fields, parameters and constructors.

#### Examples
We will
1. Look again at Antoine's `QuadraticAlgabra`; and then define
1. a structure `HasZero`, that simply endows a type with a "zero" element (you can think of it as a pointed type);
2. a structure `Magma` that endows a type with a binary operation.
3. a structure `Monoid`  that is a `Magma` with a `Zero` that **behaves like a `0`** and where `+` is associative: this will use the **extend** construction.

## Constructing terms

Let's try to buid some terms of the above structures. This can mean
* either building an explicit term of some explicit type that is a structure; or
* showing that an existing type has the (mathematical) structure implemented by our `structure`.

When doing so, `VSCode` comes at rescue: once we declare that we are looking for a term in a
structure `MyStructure` (*i. e.* in an inductive type with one constructor, itself a function with
several arguments), we can type

    def MyTerm : MyStructure :=
    _

(beware that the underscore `_` **must not be indented**), and a (blue)
bulbüí°appears. Click on it to  generate a *skeleton* of the structure at hand, so
you do not need to remember all fields by heart.

Either usingüí°or not, there are three ways to define a term of a structure:

1. `myTerm : MyStructure :=`, followed either by
    * `by constructor` and then you're in tactic mode; or
    * `{firstfield := firstterm, secondfield := secondterm, ..., lastfield := lastterm}`.

1. `myTerm : MyStructure where` and then the list `nthfield := nthterm`, each one a new (indented) line (observe that theüí°-action replaces `:=` with `where` automatically).

1. Using the so-called *anonymous constructor* provided by `‚ü®` and `‚ü©`: just insert the list of
terms `‚ü®firstterm, secondterm, ..., lastterm‚ü©` after `myTerm : MyStructure :=` and Lean will
understand.

## Classes

Although this "seems to work" there are some points that are blatantly unsatisfactory:
1. We don't have a notation `‚Ä†` that works nicely, we need to write `(NatMagma ‚Ä†) 3 2`
2. Although it is ok to be able to define arbitrary crazy additive structures on `‚Ñï`, we'd
like to record that there is a prefered one, whose name we can forget and that Lean remembers.
3. We would like things to chain automatically: we've defined a topological space on every space
  with metric, and we could define a metric on every product of metric spaces: but we don't get
  *automatically* a topology on `X √ó Y`...

**Type classes** are the solution (in `Lean`, other proof assistants, like `Rocq`, take a different\
approach).

The idea is to build a database of terms of structures (like `NatMonoid : Monoid ‚Ñï` or
`RealMetric : SpaceWithMetric ‚Ñù`) that can be searched by `Lean` each time that it looks for some
property or some operation on a type

This will also enable more flexible notation: if Lean will see `3 ‚Ä† 2` it will
1. Understand `‚Ä†` as the function `?Œ± ‚Üí ?Œ± ‚Üí ?Œ±` coming from a term `?t : Magma ?Œ±` (where both
`?a` and `?t` are still to be determined)
2. Realise that `2` and `3` are terms of type `‚Ñï`, so `?Œ± = ‚Ñï`
3. It follows that `?t` must be a term of type `Magma ‚Ñï`
4. Looking in the database, it will find the term `NatMagma : Magma ‚Ñï` and it will understand
what `‚Ä†` in this context mean.

Before moving to the examples, observe that with all good news there are also drawbacks: if we've
not been careful enough and we've recorded both `NatMagma` and `NatMagma'` as terms in `Magma ‚Ñï`,
`Lean` will find both of them in the database and will (basically) randomly pick one or the other.
